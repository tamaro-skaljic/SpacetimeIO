# SpacetimeIO

Spacetime **I**nput **O**utput is set to become the standard [Spacetime**DB**](https://spacetimedb.com/) data importer & exporter - developed by the [Spacetime**DB** community](TODO).

> [!IMPORTANT]

Spacetime**IO** consists of three things:

- A **C**ommand **L**ine **I**nterface (CLI),

- A Spacetime**DB** Client to export and import data (which is generated by the CLI) and

- A Code Snippet to paste into your Spacetime**DB** Server Module to allow importing data (also generated by the CLI).

## Getting started

- from our [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/tamaro-skaljic/SpacetimeIO/releases) or
